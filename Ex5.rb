# A gaming company has collected gaming status for a set of users whoâ€™s names are available in players array. 
# The data collected by the company is indicated by the gameData array. The data is required to be processed. 
# Create a method that accepts the data and process it in such a way that the method returns an array of hashes 
# where each hash represent a user who belong to the players array and each hash should have following 3 keys:
# name : player name
# games: is an array of hash where each hash 2 keys
# 			name: game name 
# 			status: status of the player for that particular game
# location: name of the location the player have played in.
